# Ignite Workshop Guide: Automated Machine Learning

## About
In this workshop, you will use automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning to create a forecasting model to predict NYC energy demand. This process accepts training data and configurations settings, and automatically iterates through combinations of different feature normalization/standardization methods, models, and hyperparameter settings to arrive at the best model.

+ ### Set up an Azure Machine Learning experiment
    +



import notebook in this same repository, forecasting energy demand, find out if we can disable DNN featurization (15 minutes)
1. Add MAPE score generation
1. Feature importance and explainability (15 minutes) (play around with what-if score)
1. Deployment
1. Inferencing, steal from OJ notebook
